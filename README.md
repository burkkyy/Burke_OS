# Burke_OS

Welcome to my first operating system! 
Currently it's only a flat binary that runs in 16bit protected mode, 
but I will eventually move up to 32bit real mode. 
Maybe even long mode!

To run the os, cd into src/bootsecter and run make.
Then either use bochs or qemu (qemu is highly recommended).

To use bochs:
run cmd bochs in src/bootsector

To use qemu:
run 'make run' in src/bootsector
