# Burke_OS

Welcome to my first operating system! 
Currently it's only a flat binary that runs in 32bit protected mode, but I may 
upgrade it to long mode if I can learn how to do that 

To use the os currently, cd into Burke_OS/ and run 'make run'. qemu-i386-x86 is required.
(Currently doesnt work on real hardware... maybe later)

TO DO:
	- Have a working screen driver \
	- Have a working driver for keyboard input/output \
	- Have a working driver for mouse \
	- Add drivers for reading/writing to disk \
	- Add a FAT filesystem \
	- Add a working c cross-compilier (lmao) \
	- Create a calculator app \
	- Create a conways game of life simulator \
	- Create some graphics display \
	- Have OS work on real hardware \
	- Create a shell \
	- Add a ext4 filesystem \
	- Move to 64 bit long mode \
